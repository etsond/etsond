__________________________________________________

  
I'm a software engineer with a love for web development. I'm currently working with React to create easy-to-use and beautiful web apps. I strive to make the technology industry more accessible to aspiring developers and engineers by reaching out and share my experiences.

**Fun Facts**

🌟  The first language I used to program in was Web Development in the 10th Grade.

🍳  I've always love cooking so i owned a cooking business for a little bit

📚  I feel, The second Black Panther movie was better than the first one

࿚  I love walking trails so in my leisure time you may find me exploring somewhere

🎮  If I'm not coding, you'll likely find me playing a basketball or working out.
