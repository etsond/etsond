__________________________________________________

  
I'm a software engineer with a love for learning. I'm currently working with React to create easy-to-use and beautiful responsive web apps. One of my lifetime goal is to bridge the gap by building a compiler in my father's native language.

**Fun Facts About Me**

🌟  The first language I used to program in was Web Development in the 10th Grade.

🍳  I've always love cooking so I owned a cooking business for a little bit

💬  I feel, The second Black Panther movie was better than the first one

࿚  I love walking trails so in my leisure time you may find me exploring somewhere

✅  I speak a few languages, but i can read some better than i can speak.

⛹🏿‍♂️  If I'm not coding, you'll likely find me playing basketball(I think I am very good 😊 ) or working out.
